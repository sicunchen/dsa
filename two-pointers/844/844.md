## Solution 1: build string

Individually build the string result and then compare if two results are equal.

Time: O(m+n)  
Space: O(m+n)

## Solution 2: two pointers

Going from right to left, increment a skip counter once you see a # and skip the next (counter) characters. Compare what's left after the deleting operation.

Time: O(m+n)  
Space: O(1)
